To get started with **BikeShareApp**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zeli8888/BikeShareApp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd BikeShareApp
   ```

3. Install the dependencies (make sure using a python virtual environment with python=3.11):
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   For EC2 linux server:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r ec2_requirements.txt
   ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
- This application use Jcdecaux, OpenWeather, GoogleMap and MySQL database to offer and store data.
- To configure the project, set the following environment variables first:

    ```env
    JCKEY=your_Jcdecaux_key_here
    OPEN_WEATHER_KEY=your_OpenWeather_key_here
    GOOGLE_MAP_KEY=your_GoogleMap_key_here
    GOOGLE_MAP_ID=your_GoogleMap_Id_here

    LOCAL_DB_BIKES_URL=your_Local_DataBase_Url_here
    REMOTE_DB_BIKES_URL=your_Remote_DataBase_Url_here
    EC2_DB_BIKES_URL=your_EC2_DataBase_Url_here
    ```

- Explanation

    - **JCKEY**: Get your Jcdecaux API key from [here](https://developer.jcdecaux.com/#/home).
    - **OPEN_WEATHER_KEY**: Get your OpenWeather API key from [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).
    - **GOOGLE_MAP_KEY and GOOGLE_MAP_ID**: Get your Google Map API key from [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started).

    - **DB_BIKES_URL**: You only need to set the url for your way of database connection, example format:
    `mysql+pymysql://{username}:{password}@127.0.0.1:{port}/{database_name}`
    - **LOCAL_DB_BIKES_URL**: For local database connection.
    - **REMOTE_DB_BIKES_URL**: For local RDS database connection using SSH tunnel through EC2 using AWS service.
    - **EC2_DB_BIKES_URL**: For EC2 with RDS database connection using AWS service.

- Optional: Customize settings in [config.py](web/src/config.py) to suit your preferences

## üíª Usage
Here‚Äôs how to use **BikeShareApp**:

1. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python web/bike_share_application.py --database {your_database_connection}
   ```
    - your_database_connection is LOCAL, REMOTE, EC2 based on your DB_BIKES_URL configuration, default is LOCAL
    - For REMOTE and EC2 database connection, make sure the RDS and EC2 instance is running and SSH tunnel is established.

2. Initial Data Load: Run the following command to populate the database with availability trends data (only required once, after the first project run):
   ```bash
   python database_oneday_data/load_data.py --database {your_database_connection}
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. For EC2 instance, access at `{EC2_Public_IP}:5000`.

## üêõ Common Bugs

- Package Installation mysqlclient Failed:
    - check https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/ to install dependencies for mysqlclient package first.

- Primary Key Not Added in Database:
    - make sure you run the project first before loading data to database.
    - running the project will create tables with primary key in database if tables don't exist.
    - loading data first will result in tables creation without primary key.
    - you can delete the tables and run the project again to fix the problem.

- EC2 Security Setting:
    - make sure your EC2 instance allow the incoming traffic from your local machine (custom ip address).

- Google Map Key Restrictions:
    - make sure your google map key allow the url of this application: `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or `{EC2_Public_IP}:5000` running on EC2.
    - notice that EC2 uses dynamic public ip address, which means you need to update the url in your google map key when restarting EC2 instance.

- Domain Not Secure in Browser With EC2:
    - since this application doesn't run on https, the browser will recognize it as not secure and forbid its location access by default when it runs on EC2.
    - you can bypass this by adding `{EC2_Public_IP}:5000` to the exception list of your browser.
        - For edge, access `edge://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`
        - For chrome, access `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`
    - notice that EC2 uses dynamic public ip address, which means you need to update the url in your exception list when restarting EC2 instance.
